When creating the deployable, includable version of this project, run 

    npm install
    ng build <project-name>, 

and then in the resulting ./dist directory, run 
    ng pack
    
It will create a tarball, and you can `npm install` that tarball in the client project. This avoided an Angular, in-browser error about a nullprovider for Injector
